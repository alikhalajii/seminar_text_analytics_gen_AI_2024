## Abstract

In recent years, the reasoning capabilities of language models have been significantly improved. Notably, the use of exemplars in few-shot prompting has led to substantial progress. However, this method demands additional human annotations, resulting in extended and costly instruction-tuning for language models. Despite previous attempts at prompt design, several reasoning tasks show limited improvement, represented by a flat scaling curve. In this review, I provide an analysis of a novel approach called “chain-of-thought prompting”. The innovative technique aims to prompt language models with only a few exemplars, including intermediate steps of reasoning, following human problem-solving methods, producing superior outcomes in arithmetic, common-sense, and symbolic reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting, and achieving state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy. The findings of the paper demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves the performance of language models across various reasoning tasks, particularly when the model is scaled and has a minimum of 100 billion parameters.
